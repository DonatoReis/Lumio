# Secure Password Reset Implementation

This document outlines the secure password reset implementation that follows industry best practices for password security.

## Components Implemented

1. **PasswordResetForm Component** (`/src/components/security/PasswordResetForm.tsx`)
   - React component with real-time password validation
   - Password strength meter using zxcvbn
   - Password visibility toggles
   - CSRF token protection
   - Form validation with detailed feedback

2. **Supabase Edge Function** (`/supabase/functions/reset-password/index.ts`)
   - Server-side validation of password requirements
   - Rate limiting (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
   - Authentication via JWT
   - CSRF protection
   - Password history check to prevent reuse
   - Secure password comparison
   - Log security events

3. **Database Tables** (`/supabase/migrations/20250517_password_security.sql`)
   - `password_history` - Stores previous password hashes
   - `security_logs` - Logs security-related events
   - Row Level Security (RLS) policies
   - Helper function to identify admin users

## Security Features

- **Strong Password Requirements**:
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - Contains uppercase and lowercase letters
  - Contains numbers and special characters
  - zxcvbn score â‰¥ 3

- **Protection Against Common Attacks**:
  - CSRF protection
  - Rate limiting
  - Password history check (prevent reuse)
  - Secure password comparison (prevent timing attacks)
  - Secure storage with bcrypt/Argon2id with high cost factor

- **User Experience**:
  - Real-time validation feedback
  - Password strength meter
  - Password visibility toggle
  - Detailed error messages
  - Loading states

- **Security Hardening**:
  - Invalidates all other sessions on password change
  - Logs security events for audit trail
  - Sanitizes user input to prevent XSS

## Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy Database Migrations**:
   ```bash
   supabase migration up
   ```

2. **Deploy Edge Function**:
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy reset-password --no-verify-jwt
   ```

3. **Update Frontend**:
   - Ensure PasswordResetForm component is in `/src/components/security/PasswordResetForm.tsx`
   - Update Settings.tsx to use the PasswordResetForm component

## Testing

To test the password reset functionality:

1. Log in to the application
2. Navigate to Settings > Security
3. Try changing the password with:
   - Incorrect current password (should show error)
   - Weak new password (should show validation errors)
   - Mismatch in confirmation (should show error)
   - Valid input (should succeed and log you out)

## Monitoring

The system logs all password change events in the `security_logs` table. Monitor this table for:

- Unusual patterns of password change attempts
- Multiple failed attempts from the same user/IP
- Password changes from unexpected locations

## Future Improvements

- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) requirement for password changes
- Add geographic-based alerts for password changes from new locations
- Implement password breach checking against known data breaches
- Add additional monitoring and alerting for suspicious password change patterns
